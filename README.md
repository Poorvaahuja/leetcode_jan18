## Q2 Maximum product of the length of two panlindromic subsequences
Given a string s, find two disjoint palindromic subsequences of s such that the product of their lengths is maximized. The two subsequences are disjoint if they do not both pick a character at the same index.
Return the maximum possible product of the lengths of the two palindromic subsequences.
A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.
